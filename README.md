# Go Practice Projects

Welcome to the **Go Practice Projects** repository. This repo contains a collection of personal projects showcasing various basics, practices and http apps using Golang.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository follows a **one-folder-per-project** structure, making it easy to navigate and explore each project individually. Each project folder typically includes:

- **Source Code**: Core project files and implementation (.go files).
- **go.mod/go.sum**: Go module files for dependency management.
- **Documentation**: README or notes with a description of the project and usage instructions.
- **Examples**: Sample usage or test files (if applicable).

## Running Projects

Each project may have a different setup. Please refer to the specific README.md file in each project folder for detailed instructions.

### For Simple Projects

If the project is a single Go file, you can run it directly using:

```
go run [filename].go
```

or run main.go with:

```
go run .
```
